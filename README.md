## Research Goal
Our research questions are how trending works for individual users, and how the youtube features would help videos from individual creators to get trending on Youtube. Through using the techniques of NLP, our goal is to create a platform where Youtubers can refine their descriptions to describe their video extensively and thus reach the audience that is looking for similar content using python language. 


## Description
Youtube is the most popular online video sharing website which maintains a list of top trending videos on the platform. Trending helps viewers to see current issues on Youtube and in the world, and shorten the way to reach users' interested in. Some trends are predictable from popular artists or a new movie trailers. One of the sources of algorithm what Youtube using for this metadata is the decription content creators upload with their video. Content creators will give a brief description of their video, however, most of the description is very short recapture of the video which is incomprehensive that leads algorithm not to clearly define the insight of the video and result to fail on a video to reach its intended audience. We aim to investigate if refining the description of youtube videos would result in better reach for the video.
